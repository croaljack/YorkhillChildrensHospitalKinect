Project Brief Thing:- 

A simple rhythm and motion game using Kinect one. As the song plays bubbles/circles will appear on screen, the user must hit these (or place a body hit box within the circle) in time with the beat. As the song progresses more hit circles will appear, making the user use multiple limbs and even their head to dance to the song. 

Features we hope to implement:
Highscores
In time
Increasing difficulty (i.e more boxes at once/more speed)
It works
Introduction/welcome tutorial
Place recognition i.e. recognise user is far enough back. place them at start.

Later features:
sound fx on hitting bubbles
More songs/progression


Steps to work:
- Hello world / bubble appearing on screen
- recognition of limb being in bubble 
- recognition of popping
- sort out music
- artwork style (design bubbles/how they display on time)
- scoring mechanism
- try to get everything in time somehow 
- welcome tutorial
- getting user to stand in the correct place


Kinect Ideas:
	- Need Body Frame Data – See http://kinect.github.io/tutorial/lab06/index.html
	- Display Body Mask – See http://kinect.github.io/tutorial/lab05/index.html
		-Want monochrome body shape. See sample program – Body Index Basics
	- Draw shapes on screen
		- Have shapes move, animate on screen.
		- First squares, then circles.
		- Ignore other bodies on screen.
